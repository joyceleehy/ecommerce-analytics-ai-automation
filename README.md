## Data Model

A star-schema style data model was created in Power BI to support efficient reporting and KPI analysis.

### Fact Tables
- Orders
- Payments

### Dimension Tables
- Customers
- Products
- Sellers
- Dates

Relationships were optimized for drill-down analysis and dashboard performance.

## AI-Assisted Insights Layer

The project includes an automated insights engine located in:

```text
ai/insights_generator.py
```

It generates business insights directly from SQLite KPI outputs.

Due to API limitations (Google Gemini / Anthropic Claude free tiers), a rule-based engine was implemented instead.

This ensures:

- Fully reproducible outputs
- No external API dependency
- Consistent insight generation

---

## Automation

GitHub Actions automates the data pipeline:

```text
.github/workflows/data_pipeline.yml
```

It:

- Runs Python ETL scripts
- Validates datasets
- Updates SQLite database
- Ensures reproducibility

---

## Business Impact

This project enables:

- Monitoring of sales performance
- Identification of high-value customers
- Understanding of retention behavior
- Product category performance tracking
- Payment method analysis
- Data-driven decision making

---

## Future Enhancements

- Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
- RFM segmentation
- Sales forecasting models
- Real-time dashboard refresh
- Cloud data warehouse integration
- Automated reporting emails
